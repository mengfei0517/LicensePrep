## 🎓 Exam Special Tips

### Examiner Observation Points:

1. **Whether actions are standard** - Not going through motions, but actually checking
2. **Whether sequence is reasonable** - Though sequence can vary slightly, should be logical
3. **Whether key items omitted** - Especially mirrors, seat, seatbelt
4. **Whether actions are obvious** - Let examiner clearly see what you're doing

### Exam Techniques:

- **Slow down slightly**: Let examiner see each step clearly
- **Obvious adjustment amplitude**: Even if mirror looks suitable, adjust it
- **Can self-talk**: Softly say "seat...mirrors...seatbelt..." to remind yourself
- **Don't rush**: Even if examiner is waiting, complete checklist fully

### If something is omitted:

- **Remedy immediately**: If forgot to adjust mirror, add it immediately
- **Don't panic**: One small omission doesn't necessarily lead to failure
- **Continue focus**: Don't let one mistake affect subsequent performance
