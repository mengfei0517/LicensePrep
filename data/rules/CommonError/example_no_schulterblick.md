# Not Performing Blind Spot Check (Schulterblick) When Changing Lanes

## 📋 Error Description

**Schulterblick** (shoulder check/blind spot check) refers to **turning your head to quickly observe the vehicle's side-rear blind spot over your shoulder** before changing lanes, merging, or turning.

This is **one of the most common reasons for failing the German driving exam** and also one of the most easily overlooked safety operations in actual driving. Many students, especially those from other countries, are accustomed to only checking mirrors before changing lanes without performing Schulterblick, which is **absolutely unacceptable** in the German driving exam.

**Key Facts**:
- 📊 About 30-40% of driving exam failures are related to missing Schulterblick
- ⚠️ Blind spots can "hide" a complete car, motorcycle, or bicycle
- 🚫 Even with perfectly adjusted mirrors, blind spots still exist

## 🎯 Typical Scenarios

Schulterblick is **mandatory** in the following scenarios:

- Scenario 1: **Changing lanes/merging** - Before changing left or right (most common scenario)
- Scenario 2: **Overtaking** - Before changing left to overtake
- Scenario 3: **Autobahn merging** - Before merging from acceleration lane onto autobahn main road
- Scenario 4: **Starting from curb** - When starting from curbside parking into traffic lane
- Scenario 5: **Left turn** - Before left turn in certain situations (e.g., with bike lane)
- Scenario 6: **Opening car door** - Before opening door after parking (to avoid hitting cyclists)
- Scenario 7: **Exiting roundabout** - Before preparing to exit roundabout

## ❌ Error Manifestations

**Error Behavior Examples**:
1. **Only checking mirrors**:
   - Check rearview mirror ✓
   - Check corresponding side mirror ✓
   - Turn head to check blind spot ✗ ← **Fatal omission**
   - Directly signal and change lanes

2. **Fake Schulterblick**:
   - Only slight head movement or nod
   - Eyes don't actually look at blind spot
   - Movement too quick, just "going through motions"
   - Examiner can clearly see you didn't actually observe

3. **Wrong timing**:
   - Only turning head after already starting lane change (too late)
   - Only checking once after signaling (should check again at merge moment)

4. **Missing scenarios**:
   - Forgetting Schulterblick when merging onto autobahn
   - Forgetting Schulterblick when starting from curb
   - Thinking "I just checked, don't need to check now"

## ⚠️ Serious Consequences

### Exam Consequences
- 🚫 **Immediate failure** (Durchfallen) - Regardless of how well other parts of exam went
- 💬 Examiner will explicitly state: "Sie haben den Schulterblick nicht gemacht" (You didn't perform the blind spot check)
- 📅 Need to reschedule exam, wait weeks or even months
- 💰 Retest cost: About €150-250 (exam fee + instructor accompaniment fee)

### Real Driving Consequences
- 🚲 **Collision with bicycle/motorcycle**:
  - Bicycles and motorcycles are small, fast, most likely to be in blind spot
  - Collision consequences are severe, cyclists usually seriously injured
- 🚗 **Scraping with other cars**:
  - Blind spot vehicles may be overtaking at high speed
  - Sudden lane change causes other party to brake hard or lose control
- 👨‍⚖️ **Legal liability**:
  - Accident responsibility usually 100% on party who didn't check blind spot
  - Insurance may refuse claim (considered gross negligence)

### Legal Consequences
- Fine: €100-200 (if causing danger or accident)
- Points: 1 point (Flensburg points system)
- Serious accident: May face criminal prosecution

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

Why do so many people make this error?

1. **Cause 1: Cultural difference**
   - Many countries don't emphasize Schulterblick, only require checking mirrors
   - Students bring existing driving habits, not adapted to German requirements
   - Think "mirrors are sufficient"

2. **Cause 2: Insufficient technical understanding**
   - Don't understand actual size and danger of blind spots
   - Think "well-adjusted mirrors eliminate blind spots" (this is a misconception)
   - Don't know how large modern vehicle A-pillar and C-pillar blind spots are

3. **Cause 3: Psychological factors**
   - **Nervous forgetting**: Mental tension during exam, forget this action
   - **Attention overload**: Handling too many tasks simultaneously (speed, direction, signs), omit Schulterblick
   - **Chance-taking mentality**: "Should be no car this time, don't need to check"

4. **Cause 4: Physical habit not developed**
   - Schulterblick needs to become **muscle memory**, not based on thinking
   - Insufficient practice, hasn't become automated action
   - Only practiced temporarily before exam, easily forgotten under pressure

## ✅ Correct Approach

### Correct Schulterblick Steps:

**Complete lane change observation procedure (Mirror-Signal-Shoulder-Turn)**:

1. **Step 1: Rearview mirror**
   - Quick glance at rearview mirror
   - Understand overall rear traffic situation

2. **Step 2: Corresponding side mirror**
   - Check side mirror of lane you're merging into
   - Check for vehicles to rear and side-rear

3. **Step 3: Activate turn signal**
   - Signal in direction of lane change
   - At least 3 seconds in advance (city) or 5 seconds (autobahn)

4. **Step 4: First Schulterblick** ⭐
   - **Turn head** to look at blind spot (about 45-60 degrees back)
   - **Hold for 0.5-1 second** (not instant glance)
   - **Eyes actually see side-rear window area**
   - **Confirm no vehicles in blind spot**

5. **Step 5: Prepare to change lanes**
   - Quick look ahead again
   - Quick glance at mirror again

6. **Step 6: Second Schulterblick** (recommended) ⭐
   - At moment of starting lane change, quick head turn to confirm again
   - Ensure no new vehicles entered blind spot in those 0.5-1 seconds

7. **Step 7: Execute lane change**
   - Smoothly turn steering wheel
   - Maintain observation of ahead and mirrors

### Key Points:

✅ **Obvious head movement**:
  - Turn head at least 45 degrees, let examiner clearly see
  - Shoulders should have obvious rotation
  - Not nodding or only moving eyes

✅ **Eyes actually look at blind spot**:
  - Vision should pass through side-rear window
  - Looking at area behind vehicle C-pillar
  - Not looking inside car or at mirror

✅ **Sufficient time**:
  - Hold for 0.5-1 second, not too quick
  - But don't turn head too long affecting front observation (max 1 second)

✅ **Multiple checks**:
  - Performing Schulterblick twice at critical moments is safer
  - First time: Decide if lane change is possible
  - Second time: Final confirmation at merge moment

## 🛡️ Prevention Strategies

### Strategy 1: Build muscle memory
- **Repeated practice**: Perform Schulterblick every lane change until it becomes automated
- **Practice goal**: At least 50-100 conscious practices
- **Daily reinforcement**: Practice even when moving slowly in parking lot

### Strategy 2: Use mnemonic
- **"Mirror-Signal-Shoulder-Turn"** (Spiegel - Blinker - Schulter - Rüber)
  - Mirror: Check mirrors
  - Signal: Activate turn signal
  - Shoulder: Turn head to check blind spot (Schulterblick)
  - Turn: Turn steering wheel to change lanes
  
- **Recite this mnemonic every lane change** until it becomes habit

### Strategy 3: Understand actual blind spot size
- **Experiment**: Have friend drive or cycle in your blind spot position, observe from driver's seat
  - Even with optimally adjusted mirrors, there's still a 2-3 meter blind spot
  - This blind spot is enough to "hide" a motorcycle or bicycle
- **Understand danger**: Will take Schulterblick more seriously after truly understanding

### Strategy 4: Pre-exam reinforcement
- **Week before exam**: Exaggerate Schulterblick during every practice
- **Day of exam**: Review "Mirror-Signal-Shoulder-Turn" mentally before getting in car
- **During exam**: Make movements obvious, better exaggerated than unclear

## 💡 Mnemonic

### Main Mnemonic
**"Mirror-Signal-Shoulder-Turn, safety never late"**

### German Mnemonic
**"Spiegel, Blinker, Schulterblick - erst dann kommt der Spurenwechsel!"**
(Mirror, signal, blind spot check - only then comes the lane change!)

### Key Points
- 🔄 **Schulterblick cannot be skipped**: No situation allows omission
- 👀 **Real check not fake**: Examiner can distinguish real from fake
- ⏰ **In advance not late**: Must do before lane change, not during
- 🔁 **Repeat to habit**: Must practice until automatic without thinking

## 📚 Related Rules

### StVO Relevant Provisions
- **§ 7 Abs. 5 StVO**: Though not explicitly mentioning Schulterblick, "must observe sufficiently" is implied requirement
  
- **§ 5 Abs. 4 StVO**: "Beim Fahrstreifenwechsel muss ausreichende Seitenabstand eingehalten werden"
  - When changing lanes, sufficient lateral distance must be maintained, requiring blind spot observation

### Driving Exam Evaluation Criteria
According to German driving exam evaluation standards (Fahrerlaubnis-Verordnung - FeV):
- **Serious error (Schwerer Fehler)**: Not observing blind spot when changing lanes
- **Consequence**: Directly leads to exam failure
- **No remedy opportunity**: Unlike minor errors, this type cannot be compensated by other good performance

## 📌 Summary

**Schulterblick is an iron rule in German driving exams, no negotiation.**

Remember:
- 🎯 **Mandatory**: Must do for every lane change, merge, entry
- 👁️ **Real check**: Must actually look at blind spot, not fake action
- 🔄 **Habit**: Must practice until muscle memory
- ⚠️ **Consequence**: One omission in exam = immediate failure

**Better exaggerated than missing!**
