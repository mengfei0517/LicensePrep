# Vorfahrt (Right of Way/Priority)

## 🏷️ Term Information

- **German**: Vorfahrt / Vorfahrtsrecht
- **English**: Right of way / Priority
- **Chinese**: 优先权、路权、优先通行权
- **Abbreviation**: None

## 📖 Definition

**Vorfahrt** refers to the **priority right** that one road user has over other road users at intersections, merging points, etc. The party with Vorfahrt may proceed first, while others must wait or yield.

## 🎯 Detailed Explanation

Vorfahrt is one of the core concepts in the German traffic rules system. It clearly defines who should go first and who should wait at intersections, merging points, etc.

### Key Points:

1. **Legal mandate**: Vorfahrt is not courtesy, but a clearly defined legal right and obligation
2. **Determined by signs**: Established through traffic signs, signals, or default rules
3. **Absolute nature**: The party with Vorfahrt has absolute priority, others must yield
4. **Clear responsibility**: Violating Vorfahrt rules usually means bearing accident liability

### Hierarchy for Determining Vorfahrt:

1. **Level 1: Police direction** - Police hand signals take precedence over everything
2. **Level 2: Traffic signals** - Traffic light indications
3. **Level 3: Traffic signs** - Priority signs (such as stop signs, yield signs)
4. **Level 4: Right before left** - When no signs exist, apply "Rechts vor Links" (right before left)

## 📝 Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Intersection Priority

At crossroads or T-junctions, determine who has Vorfahrt through signs or rules:
- **Vehicles with Vorfahrt**: May maintain speed through (but still need to be careful)
- **Vehicles without Vorfahrt**: Must stop or slow down to yield

### Scenario 2: Main Road and Side Road Merging

When entering main road from side road:
- **Main road vehicles have Vorfahrt**: Side road vehicles must wait
- **Side road vehicles must yield**: Look for safe gap to merge

### Scenario 3: Roundabout (Kreisverkehr)

In roundabouts:
- **Vehicles already in roundabout have Vorfahrt**
- **Vehicles preparing to enter roundabout must yield**

### Scenario 4: Autobahn Merging

When merging from acceleration lane onto autobahn:
- **Main road vehicles have Vorfahrt**
- **Acceleration lane vehicles must find gap to merge**

## 🖼️ Examples

### Example 1: Priority Road Sign

**Scenario**: You're driving on road with "Vorfahrtstraße" (priority road) sign

**Meaning**:
- ✅ You have Vorfahrt, may pass through intersections with priority
- ⚠️ Crossing road vehicles must yield to you
- 💡 But still need to observe, practice defensive driving

### Example 2: Yield Sign (Inverted Triangle)

**Scenario**: You approach intersection and see inverted triangle "Vorfahrt gewähren" sign

**Meaning**:
- ❌ You don't have Vorfahrt
- ✅ Crossing road vehicles have Vorfahrt
- 🛑 You must slow down, stop if necessary to yield

### Example 3: Stop Sign (STOP)

**Scenario**: You approach intersection and see octagonal red "STOP" sign

**Meaning**:
- ❌ You don't have Vorfahrt
- 🛑 Must come to complete stop (speed to 0)
- 👀 May proceed only after confirming safe

## ⚠️ Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "I'm on bigger road, I have priority"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Thinking wide road or heavy traffic automatically means Vorfahrt
- ✅ **Correct**: Vorfahrt determined by signs or rules, not road size
- 💡 **Explanation**: In areas like 30 zones, even on main road, must follow "right before left" without signs

### Misconception 2: "Other party should yield, so I don't need to slow down"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Blindly trusting your Vorfahrt, passing without observation
- ✅ **Correct**: Even with Vorfahrt, must confirm other party is actually yielding
- 💡 **Explanation**: Defensive driving principle - always be prepared for others' mistakes

### Misconception 3: "Vorfahrt = Vorrang"
- ❌ **Wrong**: Thinking Vorfahrt and Vorrang are completely identical
- ✅ **Correct**: There are subtle differences between the two
- 💡 **Explanation**:
  - **Vorfahrt**: Primarily for right of way between vehicles
  - **Vorrang**: More general, also applicable to pedestrians, trams, etc.

## 🔄 Related Terms

### Vorfahrt gewähren (Yield)
- **Meaning**: Must give Vorfahrt to others, wait yourself
- **Sign**: Inverted triangle yield sign
- **Application**: Must yield to vehicles with Vorfahrt when seeing this sign

### Vorfahrtstraße (Priority Road)
- **Meaning**: Road with continuous priority rights
- **Sign**: Yellow diamond sign
- **Application**: When driving on this road, crossing vehicles at intersections must yield

### Vorrang (Priority - General)
- **Meaning**: More general priority concept
- **Difference**: Includes all road users like pedestrians, trams, emergency vehicles
- **Application**: e.g., "Trams have Vorrang"

### Rechts vor Links (Right Before Left)
- **Meaning**: Default rule at unmarked intersections
- **Relationship**: One of basic rules for determining Vorfahrt
- **Application**: Vehicles from right have Vorfahrt

## 📚 Legal Basis

### StVO § 8: Vorfahrt Rules at Intersections

**§ 8 Abs. 1**:
> "An Kreuzungen und Einmündungen hat Vorfahrt, wer von rechts kommt."

(At crossroads and T-junctions, the vehicle coming from the right has priority.)

**§ 8 Abs. 2**:
> "Wer die Vorfahrt zu beachten hat, muss rechtzeitig durch sein Fahrverhalten, insbesondere durch mäßige Geschwindigkeit, erkennen lassen, dass gewartet wird."

(Those who must observe Vorfahrt must indicate through driving behavior, especially moderate speed, that they are waiting.)

### Penalties for Violating Vorfahrt

- **Basic violation**: €25 fine
- **Causing danger**: €100 + 1 point
- **Causing accident**: €120 + 1 point
- **Serious consequences**: Possible license suspension

## 💡 Memory Tips

### Mnemonic: **"Police-Light-Sign-Default, hierarchical progression"**

1. **Police**: Police direction (highest priority)
2. **Light**: Traffic signals
3. **Sign**: Traffic signs (stop signs, yield signs, priority signs)
4. **Default**: Default rules (right before left - Rechts vor Links)

### Judgment Technique

**How to quickly determine who has Vorfahrt?**

1. **Check signs**:
   - You have priority sign (yellow diamond) → You have Vorfahrt
   - You have yield/stop sign → You don't have Vorfahrt

2. **Check signals**:
   - You have green light → You have Vorfahrt
   - You have red light → You don't have Vorfahrt

3. **No signs or lights**:
   - Vehicle from right → Other party has Vorfahrt
   - No vehicle from right → You have Vorfahrt (but still observe other directions)

### Exam Points

- ✅ Correctly identify priority signs
- ✅ Apply "right before left" rule at unmarked intersections
- ✅ Even with Vorfahrt, observe and confirm safety
- ✅ Without Vorfahrt, must clearly slow down or stop
