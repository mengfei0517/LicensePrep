# Left Turn Procedure on City Roads

## 📋 Procedure Overview

Left turning is one of the most frequent operations in the exam and also one of the most error-prone. A correct left turn includes five core elements: advance observation, signaling, lane change, yielding, and turning.

## 🎯 Prerequisites

- Condition 1: Identified the upcoming left-turn intersection
- Condition 2: Appropriate speed (typically 30-50 km/h in the city)
- Condition 3: Understanding of priority rules at the intersection (traffic lights/signs)

## 📝 Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Advance Observation and Decision

**Action**: At approximately 50-100 meters before the intersection, begin observing traffic and intersection conditions

**Observation Points**:
- Rearview mirror: Observe vehicles behind
- Left side mirror: Observe vehicles to the left rear
- Intersection signs/traffic lights: Confirm if left turn is allowed and any restrictions

**Mnemonic/Tip**: **"Mirror-Signal-Shoulder" preparation trilogy**

---

### Step 2: Activate Left Turn Signal

**Action**: After confirming left turn is possible, activate left turn signal **at least 30 meters in advance**

**Observation Points**:
- Confirm turn signal is active (dashboard indicator flashing)
- Observe if following vehicles react

**Mnemonic/Tip**: **"Sooner rather than later, signal in advance"** - Turn signals communicate with other road users

---

### Step 3: Change to Left Turn Lane (if necessary)

**Action**:
1. Check left side mirror
2. Quick head turn to check left blind spot (Schulterblick)
3. Change to left turn lane when safe

**Observation Points**:
- Ensure no vehicles on the left
- Watch for bicycles and motorcycles in left blind spot

**Mnemonic/Tip**: **"Mirror-Shoulder-Turn"** - Blind spot check is mandatory!

---

### Step 4: Approach Intersection and Reduce Speed

**Action**:
- Release accelerator, apply brake if necessary
- Reduce speed to 15-25 km/h (depending on intersection size)
- When approaching stop line, prepare to stop or pass slowly

**Observation Points**:
- Traffic light status
- Oncoming straight-through traffic
- Crossing pedestrians and cyclists

**Mnemonic/Tip**: **"Left turn must yield to oncoming straight traffic"** - This is the most important yielding rule!

---

### Step 5: Yielding Decision

**Action**: Choose based on situation:
- **Red light/stop sign**: Must stop completely at stop line
- **Green light but oncoming straight traffic**: Wait before or in middle of intersection
- **Green light and no oncoming traffic**: May proceed

**Observation Points**:
- Oncoming straight traffic (including motorcycles, bicycles)
- Oncoming right-turning vehicles (also have priority)
- Crossing pedestrians

**Mnemonic/Tip**: **"Oncoming straight > Oncoming right > Our left"** - Left turn has lowest priority

---

### Step 6: Execute the Turn

**Action**:
1. Slowly accelerate through the intersection
2. Stay in correct lane during turn
3. After turn, enter the correct lane of target road (usually right lane)

**Observation Points**:
- Continue observing oncoming traffic and pedestrians during turn
- Ensure not crossing into oncoming lane
- Vehicle straightened after turn

**Mnemonic/Tip**: **"Tight turn, don't cross lines"** - Left turns typically use a tight arc (close to intersection center)

---

### Step 7: Complete Turn and Cancel Signal

**Action**:
1. After turn completion, straighten steering wheel
2. Turn off left signal (or confirm auto-cancellation)
3. Adjust speed and continue normal driving

**Observation Points**:
- Road ahead
- Rearview mirror (confirm rear situation)
- Speedometer (adjust to appropriate speed)

**Mnemonic/Tip**: **"Turn complete, cancel signal, observe road"**

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- ❌ Mistake 1: **Signal too late or not at all** → ✅ Correct: Signal at least 30 meters in advance, giving other road users time to react
- ❌ Mistake 2: **Not yielding to oncoming straight traffic** → ✅ Correct: Even with green light, must wait for oncoming straight traffic to pass
- ❌ Mistake 3: **Crossing lines or wide turn during turn** → ✅ Correct: Left turns take tight arc, close to intersection center
- ❌ Mistake 4: **Forgetting Schulterblick (shoulder check)** → ✅ Correct: Must turn head to check blind spot before lane change
- ❌ Mistake 5: **Forgetting to cancel signal after turn** → ✅ Correct: Check and cancel signal immediately after turn completion

## 🎓 Exam Points

Examiner will pay special attention to:
1. ✅ **Signal timing** - Whether signal is activated sufficiently in advance
2. ✅ **Schulterblick** - Whether head is turned to check blind spot before lane change (mandatory exam point!)
3. ✅ **Yielding rules** - Whether correctly yielding to oncoming straight traffic and pedestrians
4. ✅ **Turn trajectory** - Whether staying in correct lane without crossing lines
5. ✅ **Speed control** - Whether turn speed is smooth and appropriate

## 💡 Practical Tips

1. **Plan ahead**: When using navigation, note left-turn intersection locations in advance to avoid last-minute lane changes
2. **Waiting position**: If waiting in intersection for oncoming traffic to pass, stop left of center, keep steering wheel straight (don't turn wheel in advance)
3. **Night left turns**: Switch to low beam when approaching intersection to avoid blinding oncoming drivers
4. **Rainy left turns**: Turn slower to prevent skidding
5. **Multi-lane left turns**: If multiple left-turn lanes exist, after choosing appropriate lane, maintain same relative position during turn (left lane to left lane, right lane to right lane)
