# Right Before Left Principle (Rechts vor Links)

## üìã Rule Overview

In Germany, when two vehicles meet at an intersection without traffic lights or signs, **vehicles coming from the right have priority**. This is one of the most fundamental and important principles in German traffic rules.

## üìñ Legal Basis

StVO ¬ß 8 Abs. 1: "An Kreuzungen und Einm√ºndungen hat Vorfahrt, wer von rechts kommt."

(At crossroads and T-junctions, the vehicle coming from the right has priority.)

## ‚úÖ Applicable Scenarios

- Scenario 1: **Unmarked intersections** - The intersection has no priority signs (such as stop signs, yield signs, or priority road signs)
- Scenario 2: **Intersections within 30 zones** - Most intersections in residential 30 km/h zones apply this rule
- Scenario 3: **Roads of equal status** - When two roads have the same status with no hierarchy

## üö´ Violation Consequences

- **Failing to yield to vehicles from the right**:
  - Fine: ‚Ç¨25-35
  - Causing danger: ‚Ç¨100 + 1 point
  - Causing accident: ‚Ç¨120 + 1 point

## üí° Key Points to Remember

**Mnemonic**: Right comes first, look left and wait

**Key Steps**:
1. Reduce speed before approaching the intersection
2. Look to the right to confirm if vehicles are approaching
3. Vehicle coming from right ‚Üí Must yield
4. No vehicle from right ‚Üí May proceed (but still observe other directions)

## üìù Important Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Even if you're on a main road**, if there are no priority signs at the intersection, you must follow the right-before-left principle
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't assume others know the rule** - Always practice defensive driving and observe all directions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Trams are an exception** - Trams (Stra√üenbahn) usually have priority and are not subject to this rule
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Also applies to bicycles** - Bicycles coming from the right also have priority
